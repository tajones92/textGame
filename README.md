# textGame
Super stupid text-based adventure game created in C#

The player goes on a magical journey through time and space,
using their vocabulary which is extremely limited due to the
game's simplicity.

For a rundown of the branch system, the master branch keeps
the build verison of the game which is the most stable.  
Working is where we share the code snippets and files 
that are actively being changed, and haven't been fully 
tested or implemented.
